== Invisible Playground Homepage

This is a Ruby on Rails application to present experimental game collective Invisible Playground's online portfolio. The application manages custom pages, images, events, projects, tags and media items in German and English. As a fun feature, the google map in the background saves its position to the server, and updates whenever someone drags it to a new location.
